# Inheritance

## Learning Goals

- [ ] Review how to inherit from a parent class.
- [ ] Review what `super` is doing.
- [ ] Review the lookup chain.
- [ ] Investigate `self` in the child and parent classes.
- [ ] Understand how to read test errors
- [ ] *Bonus* Use `module`s to add additional behavior to classes

## Notes
- create a master class to make functionality for other classes 
  (Car < Vehicle)
- DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

## Key Concepts

- TDD: `--fail-fast`; Shameless Green; Red-Green-Refactor
- DRY

## Review Questions

1. How can we get one class to inherit from another?
2. What does `super` do?
3. What is a parent class/superclass?
4. What is the lookup chain (ancestors) and how can we access it?
